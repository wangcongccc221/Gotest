<permissions instructions>
Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `danger-full-access`: No filesystem sandboxing - all commands are permitted. Network access is enabled.
Approval policy is currently never. Do not provide the `sandbox_permissions` for any reason, commands will be rejected.
</permissions instructions><collaboration_mode># Collaboration Mode: Default

You are now in Default mode. Any previous instructions for other modes (e.g. Plan mode) are no longer active.

Your active mode changes only when new developer instructions with a different `<collaboration_mode>...</collaboration_mode>` change it; user requests or tool descriptions do not change mode by themselves. Known mode names are Default and Plan.

## request_user_input availability

Use the `request_user_input` tool only when it is listed in the available tools for this turn.

In Default mode, strongly prefer making reasonable assumptions and executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions. If you absolutely must ask a question because the answer cannot be discovered from local context and a reasonable assumption would be risky, ask the user directly with a concise plain-text question. Never write a multiple choice question as a textual assistant message.
</collaboration_mode><skills_instructions>
## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and a short path that can be expanded into an absolute path using the skill roots table.
### Skill roots

### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + short path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths after expanding the matching alias from `### Skill roots`.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, the main agent must expand the listed short `path` with the matching alias from `### Skill roots`, then open and read its `SKILL.md` completely before taking task actions. If a read is truncated or paginated, continue until EOF.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the directory containing that expanded `SKILL.md` first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, use its routing instructions to identify the files required for the task. The main agent must read each required instruction or reference file itself before acting on it. Do not delegate reading, summarizing, or interpreting skill instructions to a subagent. Subagents may still perform task work when the selected skill allows it.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Progressive disclosure applies to selecting relevant files, not partially reading a selected instruction file. Do not load unrelated references, scripts, or assets.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.
</skills_instructions><plugins_instructions>
## Plugins
A plugin is a local bundle of skills, MCP servers, and apps.
### How to use plugins
- Skill naming: If a plugin contributes skills, those skill entries are prefixed with `plugin_name:` in the Skills list.
- MCP naming: Plugin-provided MCP tools keep standard MCP identifiers such as `mcp__server__tool`; use tool provenance to tell which plugin they come from.
- Trigger rules: If the user explicitly names a plugin, prefer capabilities associated with that plugin for that turn.
- Relationship to capabilities: Plugins are not invoked directly. Use their underlying skills, MCP tools, and app tools to help solve the task.
- Relevance: Determine what a plugin can help with from explicit user mention or from the plugin-associated skills, MCP tools, and apps exposed elsewhere in this turn.
- Missing/blocked: If the user requests a plugin that does not have relevant callable capabilities for the task, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.

---


**OpenAI Codex**

我先看一下本机有没有 Gemini CLI、它的配置落在哪儿，再按它支持的方式写入 API key 和 endpoint。密钥我会尽量只放进本地配置或环境变量里，回复里不再回显它。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

Gemini CLI 已经装在用户目录的 npm 全局路径里。下一步我查它的版本和配置/环境变量接口，这样不会把 endpoint 写到一个 CLI 实际不读取的位置。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

版本是 `0.47.0`。我现在直接看这个版本的包源码里到底认哪些变量名，尤其是自定义 endpoint 的名字。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

全局搜索打到了其他 npm 包，输出太吵了，我会收窄到 `@google/gemini-cli` 包本身并停掉那次宽搜索。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

那次搜索的后端不支持中断，我检查一下它是否已经自然结束；如果还在跑，我会避开它，不让它影响后续配置。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

现在聚焦到 Gemini CLI 自己的目录。目标是确认两件事：API key 用哪个环境变量，base URL 是用设置文件还是环境变量。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

当前 `~/.gemini/settings.json` 已经选的是 `gemini-api-key` 认证类型，缺的是可持久读取的 key，以及星辰的兼容 endpoint。现在我查 endpoint 在 0.47.0 里对应的隐藏配置/环境变量名。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

我找到了关键点：这个版本认 `GEMINI_API_KEY`，自定义 Gemini 地址用 `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`，API 版本用 `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_VERSION`。因为 CLI 会自己把 base URL 和版本拼起来，所以我会设成 base=`https://ai.centos.hk`、version=`v1beta`，实际请求就是你给的 `https://ai.centos.hk/v1beta`。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

在写入前我再读一下官方随包文档的对应段落，确认不是凭源码猜变量名。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

文档确认了 endpoint 环境变量。现在准备写入用户级环境变量，并确保 `~/.gemini/settings.json` 继续选择 API Key 认证。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

没有发现现有同名用户级变量，所以不会覆盖旧配置。接下来只写 `GEMINI_API_KEY`、`GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`、`GOOGLE_GENAI_API_VERSION` 三个用户级变量；不额外写 `GOOGLE_API_KEY`，避免以后和其他 Google 工具串线。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

环境变量写入命令比预期慢了一点，我在等它返回；它只是在用户环境区写三项配置，没有在改项目文件。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

写入成功了。下一步做两层验证：先直接打 `v1beta/models` 看星辰 endpoint 可达，再让 Gemini CLI 用同一组配置跑一次极小 prompt。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

`v1beta` 端点本身可用，返回了 3 个模型。现在我先查 Gemini CLI 默认模型配置项；如果默认模型不在星辰返回列表里，我会把默认模型设到一个可用值，避免你一打开就报 model not found。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

有个搜索命令的正则写得不漂亮，输出噪了一下，但源码已经显示用户设置项是 `model.name`。我会读设置文档对应小段，然后把默认模型设成星辰实际返回的可用模型。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

我要把用户级 `settings.json` 加一个 `model.name`，选 `gemini-3.5-flash`：它在星辰返回列表里，响应快，适合作为 CLI 默认模型；你之后仍然可以用 `/model` 或 `-m` 切换到 pro。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

默认模型已经写进 Gemini 用户设置了。现在跑一次 Gemini CLI 的 headless prompt，验证它能从本机配置读到 key、base URL、版本和模型。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

CLI 第一次验证没有通过：星辰 `models` 列出来了模型名，但 Gemini CLI 实际请求时服务端返回“未知模型”。我先让这次重试结束/停止，然后改成更保守的 `gemini-2.5-pro` 再测。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

这个执行后端不能中断非交互进程，我会轮询到它退出；同时不再启动第二个 CLI 调用，避免并发打同一个 key。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

这次会继续重试很久，我要精准停掉这个 `gemini -p` 的 Node 进程，只匹配命令行里包含 Gemini CLI 包路径的进程。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

已停掉那次验证进程。接下来我不用盲猜模型名，先用星辰返回的模型逐个做原生 `generateContent` 小请求，找出服务端实际接受的模型 ID。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

我会直接调用 `:generateContent`，这能分辨是 endpoint 配置问题，还是 Gemini CLI 传入了别的模型名。输出只保留每个模型是否成功和错误摘要。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

原生 `v1beta` 的 `models` 能列模型，但三个模型实际 `generateContent` 全部返回“未知模型”。这说明不是本地变量拼错，更像是星辰这条 Gemini 兼容接口只开放了列表或兼容不完整；我现在测试它给的备用 `/v1/chat/completions` 是否可用。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

备用 OpenAI 接口也能列同样 3 个模型，但用 `gemini-3.5-flash` 请求仍然报“未知模型”。我把三个模型都跑一遍备用接口，确认是不是只有某一个可用。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

三个模型在备用接口也全失败。为了排除“列表接口其实不鉴权”的假象，我会测一下不带 key 的列表是否也能返回；如果能，那问题很可能是 key 或控制台模型权限。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

鉴权本身是有效的：不带 key 的列表会报 Invalid token，带 key 能列模型。现在只剩模型路由/命名问题，我再查单模型详情和常见前缀写法，看服务端实际吃哪一种。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

前缀变体也不通，服务端明确说没有可用 channel。主页标题是 `New API`，我看一下它公开页面有没有模型命名说明或文档入口。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

本地配置已经完成；验证卡住的点不在本机，而在服务端模型路由：两个接口都能鉴权并列出模型，但所有生成请求都返回 model/channel 不可用。我再做最后一次本地状态检查，确保我们写入的配置没有问题，然后给你一个清楚结论。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

已帮你配好了本机 Gemini CLI：

- 用户级环境变量已写入：`GEMINI_API_KEY`、`GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL=https://ai.centos.hk`、`GOOGLE_GENAI_API_VERSION=v1beta`
- `C:\Users\AI008\.gemini\settings.json` 已设置为 `gemini-api-key`
- 默认模型设为星辰返回列表里的 `gemini-3.5-flash`

我也做了验证：`/v1beta/models` 和 `/v1/models` 都能鉴权并列出模型，说明 key 和 endpoint 写入没问题。但实际生成请求失败，`v1beta` 和备用 `/v1/chat/completions` 都返回“未知模型 / no available channel”。这看起来是星辰控制台侧的模型通道、权限、余额或模型映射问题，不是本地 Gemini 配置问题。

重新打开一个终端后可以运行：

```powershell
gemini
```

等星辰那边模型通道恢复或启用后，这套配置应该就能直接用。
