<permissions instructions>
Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `workspace-write`: The sandbox permits reading files, and editing files in `cwd` and `writable_roots`. Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.
# Escalation Requests

Commands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:

- Pipes: |
- Logical operators: &&, ||
- Command separators: ;
- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)

Each resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.

Example:

git pull | tee output.txt

This is treated as two command segments:

["git", "pull"]

["tee", "output.txt"]

Commands that use more advanced shell features like redirection (>, >>, <), substitutions ($(...), ...), environment variables (FOO=bar), or wildcard patterns (*, ?) will not be evaluated against rules, to limit the scope of what an approved rule allows.

## How to request escalation

IMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:

- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `"require_escalated"`
- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. "Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?"
- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.

If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with "require_escalated". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.

## When to request escalation

While commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:

- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)
- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.
- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.
- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.
- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.

## prefix_rule guidance

When choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.

### Banned prefix_rules 
Avoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request ["python3"], ["python", "-"], or other similar prefixes that would allow arbitrary scripting.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. 

### Examples
Good examples of prefixes:
- ["npm", "run", "dev"]
- ["gh", "pr", "check"]
- ["cargo", "test"]


## Approved command prefixes
The following prefix rules have already been approved: - ["E:\\NEW\\MY_HARMONY\\hvigorw.bat"]
- ["go", "test"]
- ["git", "-C", "E:/new/my_harmony"]
- ["C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\pwsh.exe", "-Command", "Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\\Users\\AI008\\.hvigor\\project_caches\\821173b1a6052304d2facf3673d35df3\\workspace; D:\\harmSdk\\command-line-tools\\bin\\hvigorw.bat assembleApp"]
- ["Remove-Item", "-LiteralPath", "entry/src/main/ets/pages/level/LevelDataTable.ets.codex_delete", "-Force"]
 The writable root is `E:\goTest`.
</permissions instructions><collaboration_mode># Collaboration Mode: Default

You are now in Default mode. Any previous instructions for other modes (e.g. Plan mode) are no longer active.

Your active mode changes only when new developer instructions with a different `<collaboration_mode>...</collaboration_mode>` change it; user requests or tool descriptions do not change mode by themselves. Known mode names are Default and Plan.

## request_user_input availability

Use the `request_user_input` tool only when it is listed in the available tools for this turn.

In Default mode, strongly prefer making reasonable assumptions and executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions. If you absolutely must ask a question because the answer cannot be discovered from local context and a reasonable assumption would be risky, ask the user directly with a concise plain-text question. Never write a multiple choice question as a textual assistant message.

### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + short path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths after expanding the matching alias from `### Skill roots`.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, the main agent must expand the listed short `path` with the matching alias from `### Skill roots`, then open and read its `SKILL.md` completely before taking task actions. If a read is truncated or paginated, continue until EOF.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the directory containing that expanded `SKILL.md` first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, use its routing instructions to identify the files required for the task. The main agent must read each required instruction or reference file itself before acting on it. Do not delegate reading, summarizing, or interpreting skill instructions to a subagent. Subagents may still perform task work when the selected skill allows it.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Progressive disclosure applies to selecting relevant files, not partially reading a selected instruction file. Do not load unrelated references, scripts, or assets.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.
</skills_instructions><plugins_instructions>
## Plugins
A plugin is a local bundle of skills, MCP servers, and apps. Below is the list of plugins that are enabled and available in this session.
### Available plugins
- `Browser`: Browser / browser-use plugin Aliases: @browser, @browser-use, browser-use, Browser, in-app browser. Use Browser, the Codex in-app browser, when the user asks to open, inspect, navigate, test, click, type, or screenshot local web targets such as localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, file:// URLs, or the current in-app browser tab. After significant frontend changes to a local app, use Browser to open the relevant local target when it is known or obvious, unless the user asks for another browser tool. For requests like "open localhost:3000" or "open to localhost:4000", navigate the in-app browser to http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:4000. Do not satisfy explicit @browser or @browser-use requests with macOS `open`, shell commands, or generic web browsing unless the user asks for another browser tool or approves a fallback.
### How to use plugins
- Discovery: The list above is the plugins available in this session.
- Skill naming: If a plugin contributes skills, those skill entries are prefixed with `plugin_name:` in the Skills list.
- Trigger rules: If the user explicitly names a plugin, prefer capabilities associated with that plugin for that turn.
- Relationship to capabilities: Plugins are not invoked directly. Use their underlying skills, MCP tools, and app tools to help solve the task.
- Preference: When a relevant plugin is available, prefer using capabilities associated with that plugin over standalone capabilities that provide similar functionality.
- Missing/blocked: If the user requests a plugin that is not listed above, or the plugin does not have relevant callable capabilities for the task, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.

**OpenAI Codex**

<permissions instructions>
Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. `sandbox_mode` is `workspace-write`: The sandbox permits reading files, and editing files in `cwd` and `writable_roots`. Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.
# Escalation Requests

Commands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:

- Pipes: |
- Logical operators: &&, ||
- Command separators: ;
- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)

Each resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.

Example:

git pull | tee output.txt

This is treated as two command segments:

["git", "pull"]

["tee", "output.txt"]

Commands that use more advanced shell features like redirection (>, >>, <), substitutions ($(...), ...), environment variables (FOO=bar), or wildcard patterns (*, ?) will not be evaluated against rules, to limit the scope of what an approved rule allows.

## How to request escalation

IMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:

- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `"require_escalated"`
- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. "Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?"
- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.

If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with "require_escalated". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.

## When to request escalation

While commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:

- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)
- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.
- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing or with a likely sandbox-related network error (for example DNS/host resolution, registry/index access, or dependency download failure), rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.
- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.
- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.

## prefix_rule guidance

When choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.

### Banned prefix_rules 
Avoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request ["python3"], ["python", "-"], or other similar prefixes that would allow arbitrary scripting.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.
NEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. 

### Examples
Good examples of prefixes:
- ["npm", "run", "dev"]
- ["gh", "pr", "check"]
- ["cargo", "test"]


## Approved command prefixes
The following prefix rules have already been approved: - ["E:\\NEW\\MY_HARMONY\\hvigorw.bat"]
- ["go", "test"]
- ["git", "-C", "E:/new/my_harmony"]
- ["C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\pwsh.exe", "-Command", "Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\\Users\\AI008\\.hvigor\\project_caches\\821173b1a6052304d2facf3673d35df3\\workspace; D:\\harmSdk\\command-line-tools\\bin\\hvigorw.bat assembleApp"]
- ["Remove-Item", "-LiteralPath", "entry/src/main/ets/pages/level/LevelDataTable.ets.codex_delete", "-Force"]
 The writable root is `E:\goTest`.
</permissions instructions><collaboration_mode># Collaboration Mode: Default

You are now in Default mode. Any previous instructions for other modes (e.g. Plan mode) are no longer active.

Your active mode changes only when new developer instructions with a different `<collaboration_mode>...</collaboration_mode>` change it; user requests or tool descriptions do not change mode by themselves. Known mode names are Default and Plan.

## request_user_input availability

Use the `request_user_input` tool only when it is listed in the available tools for this turn.

In Default mode, strongly prefer making reasonable assumptions and executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions. If you absolutely must ask a question because the answer cannot be discovered from local context and a reasonable assumption would be risky, ask the user directly with a concise plain-text question. Never write a multiple choice question as a textual assistant message.
</collaboration_mode><skills_instructions>
## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and a short path that can be expanded into an absolute path using the skill roots table.

### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + short path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths after expanding the matching alias from `### Skill roots`.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, the main agent must expand the listed short `path` with the matching alias from `### Skill roots`, then open and read its `SKILL.md` completely before taking task actions. If a read is truncated or paginated, continue until EOF.
  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the directory containing that expanded `SKILL.md` first, and only consider other paths if needed.
  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, use its routing instructions to identify the files required for the task. The main agent must read each required instruction or reference file itself before acting on it. Do not delegate reading, summarizing, or interpreting skill instructions to a subagent. Subagents may still perform task work when the selected skill allows it.
  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Progressive disclosure applies to selecting relevant files, not partially reading a selected instruction file. Do not load unrelated references, scripts, or assets.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.
</skills_instructions><plugins_instructions>
## Plugins
A plugin is a local bundle of skills, MCP servers, and apps. Below is the list of plugins that are enabled and available in this session.
### Available plugins
- `Browser`: Browser / browser-use plugin Aliases: @browser, @browser-use, browser-use, Browser, in-app browser. Use Browser, the Codex in-app browser, when the user asks to open, inspect, navigate, test, click, type, or screenshot local web targets such as localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, file:// URLs, or the current in-app browser tab. After significant frontend changes to a local app, use Browser to open the relevant local target when it is known or obvious, unless the user asks for another browser tool. For requests like "open localhost:3000" or "open to localhost:4000", navigate the in-app browser to http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:4000. Do not satisfy explicit @browser or @browser-use requests with macOS `open`, shell commands, or generic web browsing unless the user asks for another browser tool or approves a fallback.
### How to use plugins
- Discovery: The list above is the plugins available in this session.
- Skill naming: If a plugin contributes skills, those skill entries are prefixed with `plugin_name:` in the Skills list.
- Trigger rules: If the user explicitly names a plugin, prefer capabilities associated with that plugin for that turn.
- Relationship to capabilities: Plugins are not invoked directly. Use their underlying skills, MCP tools, and app tools to help solve the task.
- Preference: When a relevant plugin is available, prefer using capabilities associated with that plugin over standalone capabilities that provide similar functionality.
- Missing/blocked: If the user requests a plugin that is not listed above, or the plugin does not have relevant callable capabilities for the task, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.

我已经读到这份 WayLog 是一次比较长的历史会话导出。为了不被 5000 多行聊天记录淹没，我再抽取用户问题、结论段和涉及修改的文件，把它整理成可继续工作的上下文。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

看完了。这份 WayLog 主要是在记录你前面围绕 **鸿蒙 vs 48** 做的一串对齐工作，最有价值的是最后两块。

第一块是 **重量设置里的波形捕获**：里面已经把 48 的实现链路拆清楚了：

`0x0117 开始 → 0x0122 持续推波形 → 最近 3 包 × 每包 256 点绘图 → 黄色区间只在中间包 0~255 → 0x011D 保存 → 0x0118 停止`

并且记录里说鸿蒙之前图丑的根因是：区间用了 `0~1023`、黄色线映射整张图、Y 轴动态缩放导致波形跳动。后面已经改成按 48：固定三段、最新包在右侧、区间 `0~255`、Y 轴按 `nAccuracy` 用 `4096/65535`。

第二块是 **主管让你先弄主页和等级界面** 的差距清单。结论是：等级界面优先级更高。主要问题有：

1. 主页还保留 `FSM1/FSM2`，主管明确不要子系统切换。
2. 主页出口右键菜单少了 48 的复制、剪切、粘贴。
3. 主页底部状态按钮部分只是打日志，没有打开对应状态/设置窗口。
4. 等级页“取消”不是真取消，一些字段已经写进 `AppStorage`。
5. 改等级名称、重量、箱数等会清空出口卡片，但 48 只在等级数量变化时清空。
6. 等级保存缺少 48 的校验：名称不能为空、不能重复、最小重量递减、数值非负。
7. 下发失败时鸿蒙本地可能已经改了，没有回滚。
8. 没有按硬件能力禁用不可用分选方式。

我会把这份记录当成当前上下文：接下来如果你让我动“主页/等级”，我会优先处理 **去 FSM、等级取消/保存语义、避免无关清空出口、保存校验** 这几项。当前我只读了文件，没有改代码，也没有编译。

**User**

帮我解决一下这个出口设置里面的 点击列或者行 删除数据 remove 失败的问题 只有在特定情况下才会失败 点击列的表头 然后会取消所有的当前列 点击确认 正常是应该数据下发 然后前端出口更新 下发给后端 重启之后 没有之前被删掉的数据在出口上，但是现在是重启之后数据还在。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

使用 `superpowers:systematic-debugging` 和 `superpowers:test-driven-development`：这是一个特定条件下的删除持久化 bug，我会先追根因和影响面，再写能卡住行为的源码级检查，最后做最小修改；不编译。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

先定位复现链路：我会从“出口设置表头点击 → 列取消 → 确认保存 → 下发/持久化”的代码路径追起，重点找 UI 内存更新和真正保存到后端/设备的数据是否分叉。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

我先不动代码。现在要确认“remove 失败”到底发生在三层里的哪一层：表格选择状态、确认时构造的出口位图、以及持久化/下发给后端的数据。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

这里有个路径差异：当前 `e:\goTest` 里只扫到一个很小的 `entry/src/main/ets`，没有历史记录里那个 `my_harmony/entry/src/main/ets/pages/home` 结构。我会先确认实际项目目录在哪里，避免修错仓库。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

实际工程在 `E:\new\my_harmony`，不是当前 `E:\goTest` 这个壳工程。接下来我会只读 `E:\new\my_harmony` 的出口设置相关文件；如果确认要改那边文件，会用受控方式处理，避免改到错误目录。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

我已经定位到实际代码在 `E:\new\my_harmony`，并看到当前那里有未提交改动：波形相关两个文件、`GlobalDataInterface.ets`、两个验证脚本。我会避开这些文件，专注出口/等级映射路径。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

目前有三个可验证假设：第一，表头/行头点击只更新了表格显示，没有把要删除的矩阵单元传给等级位图；第二，确认时只做前端出口卡片更新，没有持久化到完整 `StGradeInfo`；第三，下发时被 `mergeOutletChangesWithRuntime()` 又用旧运行时出口位图覆盖。我会按这个顺序用源码和小测试排。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

关键迹象出来了：表头点击走的是多选/拖拽矩阵单元路径，删除时最终会调用 `sendDragLevelData({ action:'remove' })`，但本地合并又用运行时配置作基底。现在我要看 `sendDragLevelData` 后端动作和“重启恢复”读的是哪里，判断是设备没收到 remove，还是本地缓存没保存。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

现在能基本复现根因方向：列/行删除是 `dragLevelData remove` 的增量命令，不是完整等级配置下发；而重启后依赖设备 `StGlobal.grade` 或本地完整 `StGradeInfo`。如果增量 remove 没同步完整配置缓存，UI 当场变了，重启再读旧完整配置就会回来。我继续确认后端 `dragLevelData remove` 有没有保存缓存。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

后端增量 `dropdata remove` 本身会重新编码完整 `HC_CMD_GRADE_INFO` 并缓存，所以“重启后回来”更可能不是后端没做 remove，而是出口设置弹窗确认时没有走这个增量路径，或者完整保存时又把旧位图合并回来了。下一步直接看 `OutletDialog` 的表头/行头选择与确认。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

根因更具体了：弹窗确认时先用 `setExitMappingsFromGradeCells()` 得到“当前出口的权威选择”，但随后 `syncOutletGradeMatrix()` 调 `mergeOutletChangesWithRuntime()`；如果运行时 `gradeInfo` 还是旧数据，且合并函数没有把当前出口的 0 位当作权威删除，旧位会被合并回来。现在我要读这个合并函数并写一个源码级回归检查。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

我还要确认“点击列头/行头取消整列/整行”传出来的 `selectedGradeCells` 是否包含完整矩阵坐标。这个是特定条件失败的核心，因为空选择和整列取消都会走同一个确认入口，但语义完全不同。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

还有一个更像“特定情况”的根因：`CompositeGradeTable` 点击行头/列头时用循环连续触发多个单格 toggle；在 ArkUI `@State` 更新不是给这种批量操作设计的，父组件可能每次都基于旧的 `selectedGradeCells` 计算，导致确认时矩阵选择和视觉状态/用户意图不一致。这个比“后端 remove 不工作”更贴近你描述的“点表头才失败”。我会把测试锁在批量表头选择必须一次性提交完整选择。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

我会先把回归检查写到 `tools`，用源码规则卡住两点：表头批量选择必须有批量回调，不再靠循环单格回调；出口确认后的完整下发不能再被旧运行时位图覆盖当前出口删除。这个检查先在现状失败，证明它抓的是你说的这个 bug。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

我已经排除了一个分支：`setExitMappingsFromGradeCells()` 本身会把当前出口未选中的矩阵格 bit 清掉。剩下最危险的是完整保存到 Go 时，后端的“保留缓存出口位图”逻辑可能把旧 bit 合并回来。我现在核对这个条件。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

确认了：Go 的完整 `saveLevelData/dropdata with Grade` 默认会在“看起来像重建等级、出口位为空”的情况下合并缓存出口位。出口设置确认这条链路必须明确告诉后端“当前出口位图是权威的，不要把旧缓存合回来”。前端已经有 `preserveCachedGradeExits` 字段，但 Go 结构没有接，现有后端会忽略它。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

修复方案现在收敛成一个后端协议兼容 bug：前端已经发送了 `preserveCachedGradeExits=false`，但 Go 后端没有解析这个字段，所以仍按旧规则把缓存里的出口位图 OR 回来。我要先加 Go 回归测试，让这个字段缺失导致失败，再补最小解析逻辑。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

我会改 `e:\goTest` 的 Go 后端协议解析，不碰 `E:\new\my_harmony` 当前那些已有前端改动。测试先加在 `go/ohos/Tcp/websocket_dropdata_test.go`，证明 `preserveCachedGradeExits=false` 必须禁止合并旧出口位。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

回归测试已经写好。现在按 TDD 先跑这一组 Go 测试，看它因为函数签名/行为未实现而失败；这是预期红灯，不是编译整包。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

测试命令从仓库根跑到了没有 `go.mod` 的层级，这是路径问题，不是代码红灯。我改到 `go/ohos` 模块目录只跑同一组测试。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

红灯没有打到我新增断言，而是包里已有 `ctcp_structs_test.go` 语法错误先拦住了整个 `go test`。我不改这个无关文件；继续做最小后端修复，并用源码检查加上已有测试文件作为回归证据。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

后端现在会解析 `preserveCachedGradeExits`，并在显式 `false` 时跳过旧缓存 OR 合并。接下来把既有测试里的旧调用补成默认 `nil`，保持原先“未传字段时兼容旧行为”。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

我还会补一个显式 `true` 的边界测试：这样可以证明新字段不是简单关闭老逻辑，而是只有前端传 `false` 时才把出口设置当权威全量。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

现在做验证：Go 单测仍可能被已有语法错误挡住；除此之外我会跑格式化、源码定位和 diff 检查，确认改动只限协议字段和合并判断。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

最后做静态收尾：检查新增字段从鸿蒙前端到 Go 后端的协议名一致、diff 没有空白错误，并确认没有碰前端现有脏文件。

---


**OpenAI Codex**

已修。根因不是前端表头点击本身，而是后端把“已经删掉的出口位”又合并回来了。

**根因和影响**
前端出口设置确认时已经通过 `preserveCachedGradeExits=false` 表达“这次出口矩阵是权威结果，不要保留旧出口位”。但 Go 后端没有解析这个字段，所以 `SendGradeInfoData()` 仍按旧逻辑调用 `mergeGradeExitState()`，把缓存里的旧 `ExitLow/ExitHigh` 用 OR 合并回来。  
所以点列头/行头取消整列或整行后，界面看起来删了，确认也下发了，但真正写给设备/缓存的完整等级配置可能又带回旧出口位，重启后数据还在。

**改动文件**
- [websocket.go](E:/goTest/go/ohos/Tcp/websocket.go:83)
  - `webSocketControlMessage` 新增 `PreserveCachedGradeExits *bool`
  - [websocket.go](E:/goTest/go/ohos/Tcp/websocket.go:1529) `SendGradeInfoData()` 合并缓存前读取该字段
  - [websocket.go](E:/goTest/go/ohos/Tcp/websocket.go:2336) `shouldPreserveCachedGradeExits()` 支持显式 true/false
- [websocket_dropdata_test.go](E:/goTest/go/ohos/Tcp/websocket_dropdata_test.go:103)
  - 新增测试：`preserveCachedGradeExits=false` 时不能保留旧出口位
  - 新增测试：`preserveCachedGradeExits=true` 时仍允许保留旧出口位

**数据流**
`出口设置表格点击列/行头取消选择 → OutletDialog 确认 → 前端生成 StGradeInfo → WebSocket saveLevelData 携带 preserveCachedGradeExits=false → Go 后端 SendGradeInfoData → 不再 merge 缓存旧出口位 → 编码 HC_CMD_GRADE_INFO(0x0051) → 下发设备 → 重启后按设备配置恢复出口卡片`

**核心函数作用**
- `SendGradeInfoData()`：接收前端完整等级配置，决定是否合并缓存出口位，然后下发设备。
- `shouldPreserveCachedGradeExits()`：判断是否把后端缓存里的旧出口位合并到当前等级配置。
- `mergeGradeExitState()`：旧兼容逻辑，用 OR 保留缓存出口位；现在显式 `false` 会跳过它。

**为什么这样改**
这是最小修复：前端协议字段已经存在，缺的是后端尊重这个字段。没有改表格选择逻辑，也没有改出口位计算公式，避免影响正常拖拽和已有保存流程。

**可能影响旧功能**
未传 `preserveCachedGradeExits` 时仍走旧规则：等级数量、品质数量、分类类型相同时继续保留缓存出口位。  
只有前端显式传 `false` 的完整出口设置保存会把当前选择当作权威结果，允许删除旧出口映射。

**边界情况**
- 空选择：当前出口应清空，不再被缓存旧位恢复。
- 0 值：`ExitLow/ExitHigh=0` 会被保留为删除结果。
- 跨天/跨月/跨年：无关，这是配置下发，不依赖时间。
- 异常数据：未传字段仍兼容旧行为；显式 true/false 按前端意图执行。

**验证**
我按你的要求没有编译。尝试跑 Go 单测时被已有无关语法错误挡住：

`Tcp\ctcp_structs_test.go:19:2: expected ';', found d`

已执行：
- `gofmt` 格式化修改的 Go 文件
- `git diff --check` 通过，无空白错误
- 源码检查确认前端已有 `preserveCachedGradeExits=false` 发送链路，后端现在能接收

**需要你人工确认**
真机按你的复现路径测：进入出口设置，点击列头取消整列，点确认，确认出口卡片更新；重启后该列对应等级不应再回到出口上。
